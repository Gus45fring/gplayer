This is a music player in c++ that automatically reads files of a certain directory. It is absolutely not completed, but i still wanted to push a very early version. 

The only libraries needed are TagLib and raylib. Since i also used filesystem, you'll also need c++ 17.

I'll just finish this tomorrow.
